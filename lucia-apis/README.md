# Lucia APIs

A set of API collections based on the `lucia` framework.

All these native-supported interfaces are very important to test and exercise `lucia`. As a result, the addition of new APIs is welcome.

| Category | Name | Feature | Pct |
|---|---|---|:---:|
| Blockchain | Solana | solana | 90% |
| Calendar | Nager.Date | nager-date | 100% |
| Series | Rick And Morty | rick-and-morty | 100% |
| Test data | JSONPlaceholder | json-placeholder | 100% |

Each API's module has a documentation test for demonstration purposes.
